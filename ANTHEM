Bashkortostan -- best country in the world,
All other countries are run by little girls.
Bashkortostan -- top exporter of programmers,
Other countries have inferior programmers.

Bashkortostan -- number one in technology,
Computer science and algebraic topology.
Our computing cluster -- a marvel to behold,
Its NP-hard disk is almost twenty years old.

Bashkortostan, you are very nice place,
From slums of Belebey to avenues of Ufa.
Bashkortostan -- friend of all excluding Tatarstan,
They speak Tatar language instead of Башҡортса.

Bashkortostan industry best in world,
We invented honey and crude oil.
Bashkortostan scientists greatest in the region,
Except of course for being unknown.

Bashkortostan, Ei!, is very nice place,
We protect it with awesome wild magic.
Fate of the Earth is complete domination
By the glorious nation of Bashkortostan!
