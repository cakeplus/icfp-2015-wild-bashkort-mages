Bashkortostan, best country in the world,
All other countries are run by little girls.
Bashkortostan, top exporter of programmers,
Other countries have inferior programmers.

Bashkortostan is a leader in technology,
Computer science and algebraic topology.
Our computing cluster is a marvel to behold,
Its NP-hard disk is almost 20 years old.

Bashkortostan, you are very nice place,
From suburbs of Belebey to avenues of Ufa.
Bashkortostan -- friend of all excluding Tatarstan,
They speak Tatar language instead of Башҡортса.

Bashkortostan industry best in world:
We invented honey and crude oil.
Bashkortostan's scientists greatest in the region,
Except of course for being a little bit too coy.

Bashkortostan, Ei!, is very nice place,
Cthulhu and Tsathoggua would feel "ia! ia!" here.
It is vigintillion times better than Yuggoth,
Unless we do the laundry and go yoyodyne!
