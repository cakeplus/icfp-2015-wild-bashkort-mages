  Artem Ripatti (ripatti@inbox.ru).

Target platform:
  Ubuntu 14.04, x86-64.

Implementation language:
  The solver is written in C++ (an elegant weapon, for a more civilized
  age). Python was our tool of choice for building the necessary internal
  infrastructure (not included here); most notably the interactive
  player/visualizer and the experimental data analysis framework.
  Originally, one of the prototype solvers was implemented in OCaml,
  but the C++ one quickly proved much more promising.

Build dependencies:
  Stock GCC package (including g++).

Build instructions:
  Run 'make'.

Algorithm description:
  We have discovered a truly marvelous solution to this
  problem, but this README is too narrow to contain it.

Important notes:
  Solving the full set of the Qualifier Problems might take several
  hours on the modern commodity hardware. Please, be patient...

  ... and thanks for the awesome contest! \o/ \o/ \o/
